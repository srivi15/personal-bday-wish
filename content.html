		<p> Happiest birthday to the sweetest person ever!! Be the same sweet and crazy guy as always. </p>
		<p> There are many sweet memories of us without even meeting person to person.</p>
		<p> Our crazy chats, your cute replies, and our cute lil fites, nd more and more!!! </p>
		<p> Most probably, I would be the one who made u feel irritated but I also know that our bond is stronger than all those fites :) </p>
		<p> I feel really strange and much happier how we fite and come back to each other always. </p>
		<p> The biggest surprises of life are always given unexpectedly. You are the same to me.</p>
		<p> Rather than treating me like a juno, u always treated me with much importance!! Really blessed srivi I be !! </p>
		<p> A big thanks for tolerating me in your life and keeping me in it. Eeeee :p </p>
		<p> This is really a small effort made by me to create this wishing-website </p>
		<p> Hoping that this brings a big smile on your face </p>
		<p> In this birthday, I wish you all the success, love, happiness you want!! </p>
		<p> HAPPy BIRTHDAY!!! Hope you like this.</p>
